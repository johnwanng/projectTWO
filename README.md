# projectTWO
Project Two. Our Project team members include Andrea, Jayne and John.

We are looking to explore the FIFA world cup data and allow the user to drill down by country, world cup year, then into further information potentially including players profiles, match results and other generalised information. 

Using a dashboard page to display various plots based off the same dataset. 

Including a world map reference to country locations with markers/bubbles for wins in the competition. 

Drops downs to show players playing for specific countries for each year, once already filtered on a country. 

Data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup?select=WorldCups.csv
